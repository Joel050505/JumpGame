Welcome to Chase Willie the runner, a fun and engaging game inspired by infinity running games that work both on mobile and desktop. This project was built by a student from Chas Academy while learning Javascript, Html and CSS. The game challenges players to jump over an obstacle, purchase characters, and track their high scores. The higher the score is the faster the game speed is so its the further you run down. This project mainly focused on game mechanics with DOM manipulation and javascript.

## Features

- **Point System** â€“ Earn score each time you jump over the obstacle. Everytime you jump over it your score gets updated with 1. The faster the obstacles go against you the faster you get score.

- **High Score Tracking** â€“ Your best score is saved locally using localStorage. If you collide with the obstacle than it's game over, and your score is higher than your previous high score, it will be saved.

- **Coin System** â€“ Each time you collide with the obstacle you will get your coins depending on your score and you can use them to purchase characters. Coins are earned 1:10 with score.

- **Character Selection** â€“ Choose one free character and three additional characters you can buy. You can buy characters with coins.

## Technologies Used

- **Javascript** â€“ Vanilla javascript.

- **CSS** â€“ CSS for styling.

- **HTML* â€“ For layout.
